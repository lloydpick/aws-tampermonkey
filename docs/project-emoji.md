As the table columns are quite short and you might be repeating project names quite frequently this allows you to set an emoji to display when a project name is matched.

You can control which emojis are shown per project, the setting for that can be found here...

An example format for the settings is each line being an entry separated with a comma, for example...

    my-testing-project,üõÇ
    my-building-project,üèóÔ∏è
