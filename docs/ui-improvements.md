The UI makes some strange and odd choices when displaying some of the data again. Changes made...

* Show full dates and time, instead of fluffy dates
* Widen the "Date" column so date is never cropped
* Cut down incredibly wordy text on the "Finding" column so you can always see the most important text for both CVE entries and CIS Benchmark results.
